# Google BigLake Metastore

**[Google BigLake Metastore](https://docs.cloud.google.com/biglake/docs/about-blms)** 
is a fully managed, unified metastore service for data lakes on Google Cloud.

To use Google BigLake Metastore with Lance, you can leverage BigLake's [Iceberg REST Catalog](https://docs.cloud.google.com/biglake/docs/blms-rest-catalog),
which exposes an Apache Iceberg REST Catalog-compatible interface.

See [Lance Namespace integration with Iceberg REST Catalog](iceberg.md) for more details.
